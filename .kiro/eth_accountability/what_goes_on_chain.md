# What Goes On-Chain

## Why Only Cryptographic Commitments Are Recorded

The distributed ledger contains only mathematical fingerprints of decisions rather than the decisions themselves, providing accountability while preserving privacy and minimizing exposure.

### Commitment vs Content Separation

**Proof Without Disclosure**

- Mathematical fingerprints prove that specific decisions were made at specific times without revealing the decision content
- Users can verify that their data was used for decisions without exposing their financial information to public inspection
- Regulatory compliance can be demonstrated without disclosing proprietary decision logic or sensitive user circumstances
- Dispute resolution can proceed with verifiable evidence while maintaining confidentiality of personal financial details

**Privacy Preservation**

- User financial information never appears on public ledgers where it could be accessed by unauthorized parties
- Decision logic and proprietary algorithms remain confidential while still providing accountability for their outputs
- Personal risk assessments and financial circumstances are protected from public disclosure while maintaining verifiable decision records
- Sensitive business information and competitive advantages are preserved while enabling transparent accountability

**Selective Disclosure Control**

- Users can choose when and to whom to reveal decision details while maintaining permanent proof that decisions were made
- Regulatory authorities can verify compliance without requiring public disclosure of sensitive information
- Dispute resolution can proceed with controlled information sharing rather than public exposure
- Professional consultations can include verifiable decision history without compromising user privacy

### Mathematical Integrity Assurance

**Tamper Evidence**

- Any alteration to decision records creates detectable changes in mathematical fingerprints that cannot be hidden or disguised
- Decision integrity can be verified without access to the original decision content or internal system operations
- Historical decision accuracy can be confirmed even when original systems or organizations are no longer available
- Fraud detection becomes possible through mathematical verification rather than trust-based audit processes

**Computational Verification**

- Decision authenticity can be verified through mathematical calculation rather than organizational attestation
- Independent parties can confirm decision integrity without requiring access to internal systems or cooperation from service providers
- Automated verification processes can detect tampering or fraud without human intervention or subjective judgment
- Cross-system verification becomes possible through standardized mathematical approaches rather than proprietary audit procedures

## Why Hashes Are Used Instead of Raw Data

Mathematical fingerprinting provides the benefits of permanent record-keeping while avoiding the risks and limitations of storing actual decision content on distributed ledgers.

### Storage Efficiency and Cost Management

**Minimal Data Footprint**

- Mathematical fingerprints require minimal storage space compared to complete decision records and supporting documentation
- Network costs are minimized by storing only essential accountability information rather than comprehensive decision details
- System scalability is preserved by avoiding the storage limitations that would result from comprehensive on-chain data storage
- Long-term sustainability is maintained by minimizing the ongoing costs associated with permanent record storage

**Network Performance Preservation**

- Small mathematical fingerprints do not create network congestion or performance degradation that large data records would cause
- Transaction processing remains efficient by avoiding the computational overhead of storing and verifying large data sets
- System responsiveness is maintained by limiting distributed ledger operations to essential accountability functions
- Network capacity is preserved for critical accountability functions rather than comprehensive data storage

### Privacy and Security Protection

**Information Exposure Minimization**

- Mathematical fingerprints reveal no information about decision content, user circumstances, or proprietary algorithms
- Privacy breaches are prevented by ensuring that sensitive information never exists in publicly accessible formats
- Competitive advantages are protected by avoiding disclosure of proprietary decision logic or business processes
- User confidentiality is maintained even in the event of system breaches or unauthorized access to distributed ledger data

**Attack Surface Reduction**

- Limited on-chain data reduces the potential value and impact of attacks on distributed ledger infrastructure
- Security risks are minimized by ensuring that compromised distributed ledger access cannot reveal sensitive information
- System vulnerabilities are reduced by limiting the types of information that could be exposed through security failures

- Interoperability is preserved by using mathematical approaches that do not depend on proprietary systems or formats

## How Minimal On-Chain Data Reduces Risk

Limiting distributed ledger content to essential accountability information reduces multiple categories of risk while preserving the core benefits of permanent, verifiable record-keeping.

### Privacy and Confidentiality Risk Reduction

**Data Exposure Prevention**

- Minimal on-chain data ensures that privacy breaches cannot reveal sensitive user information or proprietary business processes
- Regulatory compliance risks are reduced by avoiding public disclosure of information that should remain confidential
- Competitive risks are minimized by protecting proprietary algorithms and decision logic from public inspection
- User trust is preserved by ensuring that personal financial information cannot be accessed through distributed ledger compromise

**Long-Term Privacy Protection**

- Regulatory changes that might affect privacy requirements cannot retroactively compromise information that was never publicly stored
- Technology evolution cannot create new privacy vulnerabilities for information that exists only as mathematical fingerprints
- Cross-border privacy compliance is simplified by avoiding storage of information that might be subject to varying international privacy laws

### Security and Attack Risk Mitigation

**Attack Incentive Reduction**

- Compliance verification can focus on essential accountability functions rather than comprehensive data management practices
- Regulatory reporting is streamlined by avoiding the complexity that would result from comprehensive on-chain data storage
- Professional liability is reduced by limiting distributed ledger operations to functions that clearly serve user protection and regulatory compliance

## Why Anchoring Is Event-Driven, Not Continuous

Distributed ledger anchoring occurs only when significant decisions are made rather than continuously, reflecting the focused application to accountability for specific high-stakes determinations.

### Efficiency and Cost Optimization

**Resource Conservation**

- Event-driven anchoring minimizes network costs by creating distributed ledger records only when accountability is specifically required
- System performance is optimized by avoiding continuous distributed ledger operations that would create unnecessary overhead
- Operational costs are controlled by limiting distributed ledger use to situations where its unique properties provide clear value

- Accountability resources are focused on decisions with significant consequences rather than routine system operations
- Decision significance is clearly communicated through the act of distributed ledger anchoring
- Regulatory compliance is enhanced by clearly identifying decisions that meet professional standards for accountability

**Decision Context Preservation**

- Event-driven anchoring captures complete decision context at the moment of determination rather than fragmenting it across continuous logging
- Decision integrity is preserved by creating comprehensive accountability records for complete decision processes
- Temporal accuracy is enhanced by anchoring decisions at the precise moment they are finalized rather than approximating through continuous logging
- Dispute resolution is facilitated by having clear, complete records of specific decision events rather than reconstructing decisions from continuous logs

### User Understanding and Trust

**Transparency and Comprehension**
